Templating Component
====================

Templating provides all the tools needed to build any kind of template system.

It provides an infrastructure to load template files and optionally monitor
them for changes. It also provides a concrete template engine implementation
using PHP with additional tools for escaping and separating templates into
blocks and layouts.
